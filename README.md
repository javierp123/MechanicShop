Mechanic shop terminal 

This mechanic shop will be interacted in the terminal. Where you are able to make invoices, make appoitments, check appoinments of customers and check if there is parts avalible
for at the shop that the customer needs. Used python and SQL alchemy to use ORMs to have a database avalible to save these actions stated above.

How to run: Load into IDE where you can run the the web.py file, will need to have sql alchemy downloaded on your machine to make this work.


The purpose of this project is to use use ORMs to make a database and understand how user input and ORMS and databases can work all together. 

In the future I plan to add a front end to help with usability.
